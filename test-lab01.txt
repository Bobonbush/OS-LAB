Epstein replied, “you are always welcome. . there are many many nights of unique talents. you will be invited often”

The Wall Street Journal first reported Karp’s resignation. A spokesperson for the firm, fully named Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton & Garrison LLP, previously told the paper, “Mr. Karp never witnessed or participated in any misconduct. Mr. Karp attended two group dinners in New York City and had a small number of social interactions by email, all of which he regrets.”

In June 2016, Karp asked Epstein if he could help get his son a job on an upcoming Woody Allen film.

Karp wrote that his son “would love to work, in any capacity, with Woody on his upcoming film project, if that’s a possibility. He certainly doesn’t need to be paid and he’s a really good, talented kid. Thanks so much. Brad”

Epstein replied, “i will ask, of course. can you tell me what role he would like to fill , i know little about the movies”

Karp made headlines last March after meeting with President Donald Trump and reaching a deal for the president to rescind his executive order that suspended security clearances for lawyers and staff at the law firm.
